The biggest thing I learned in this class is the importance of nonverbal communication. This stood out to me probably because its the area of communication in which I need most improvement. The way you hold yourself and the way you speak are just as important as what you say. I never understood that before. It was one thing to be told that in class; it was an entirely different thing to have to work through it in our many class activities.

I’ve learned that I really do enjoy public speaking. It still makes me nervous, but I know I can do it now. I just need to practice my posture and tone when speaking. Thanks for making class so engaging and fun. I haven’t been in a class like this. Now I know why everyone recommends taking you!
