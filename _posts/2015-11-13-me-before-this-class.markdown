Before this class I believe I was a mediocre communicator. Now I realize I’ve got plenty of things to work on. Before this class I really just thought of speaking when I thought of communication, although I’m one that communicates through actions mostly. Spending quality time with someone is the way I express love. In more general communication, I’m one to be very straightforward with my words. Sometimes they go unheard though. What I mean by this is that I know what I want to communicate in most cases, but my method of communication is often easily missed by others. I think such a subtle form of communication doesn’t mesh well with everyone.
