**Section 8**

I chose to talk about digital media and the positive and negative effects it has on the way we think. I chose this because it is related in some ways to my major and I find it very interesting. I’ve done plenty of research on the topic so it wasn’t a big deal for me to think about how I could make it into a speech. I figured it’d be most natural to speak on a subject I’m already very familiar with.

Out of my classmates’ speeches, my favorite was one about Tupac. I’ve never really listened to his music - nor do I know much about him, but it was obvious that the girl presenting was a huge fan of the man. She described his life with such detail and animation that I felt as if she knew him personally. Speaking from a state of adoration and respect like that made it very easy to listen to her and retain what she said.
