Personally, one of the most life changing talks I’ve been given was from my older brother. He gave me a pep talk before my state cross country meet. The talk was so inspiring because of how much I respect him. I trusted every word he said and that allowed me to take it all in without having to consider its trustworthiness first. It was timely as well because it had been a while since I had seen him and the meet was only a day away. It was also given in a moment where it was just us alone. It’s much harder to be inspired by someone you don’t personally know. There’s just so much value in knowing someone deeply - and understanding all that they stand for. It’s these aspects that made the experience have such a long lasting impression on me.
