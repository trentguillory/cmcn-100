Before our class on nonverbal communication, I hadn’t realized how even the smallest gesture can send a message. One of the most common forms of nonverbal communication is eye contact. This can suggest that you’re paying attention, or it can even be done in a threatening way. This is one way nonverbal connects to gender. In an intense situation, a man may use eye contact to intimidate or warn another. Another form of nonverbal communication is one’s posture and movement. Crossed arms or hands in pockets(in some cases) suggests disinterest. Posture and other gestures play a big part in our cultural hospitality. Chivalrous gestures like opening the door for someone or pausing to allow someone to walk before you are basic nonverbal statements. Others are the way you show interest when someone is speaking by facing them and having a non-dead facial expression. Another common one is doing someone a favor without their asking. Seeing a need and filling it is another way to nonverbally communicate to someone how much you value them.
