**Section 5**

Relationships vary greatly depending on how intimate they are. Intimacy is based on how much of a “connection” there is. Whether it’s a conscious decision or not, we decide whether or not we want to get to know someone more based on our initial verbal and nonverbal communication with that person. Friendships naturally progress as communication transcends just speaking - people began to share experiences with each other.  Intimacy is based on how many shared memories two people have together. That includes things experienced together or stories told to each other.
