**Section 3**

Our gender is a major part of our identity. Our identity colors every form of communication we may use. On the intrapersonal level, gender in some part dictates what we tell ourselves and tints our goals. Men are more likely to handle an intense situation physically, whereas women are more likely to talk it out (no matter how animated the conversation may get). Gender in communication is also seen in small group roles. Many times it is the women of the group that are given secretary-like tasks that involve writing. The guys take up the broader tasks like planning and leading.
