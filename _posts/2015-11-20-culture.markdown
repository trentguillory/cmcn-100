**Section 2**

In South Louisiana, our culture is largely communicated through hospitality. Even if it is feigned at times, a sense of politeness pervades all of our interactions. In the work setting, this is a part of the standard for dialogue between coworkers. The same type of communication is seen in entertaining guests. We have many nonverbal queues that say “You matter,” like holding the door open for people or inviting them to have a meal with you. In more personal situations, this rigid, sometimes forced hospitality gives way to true friendship. Hospitality slowly evolves into something we do because we care for each other rather than something we do because it is the norm.
