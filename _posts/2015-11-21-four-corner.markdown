The four corner debate allowed for multiple levels of communication to happen at once. In our individual corners, the environment was casual and more intimate 1 on 1 type of speaking. In that small group, we had to refine our overall message for speaking to the larger group, which was much more like public speaking. Seeing how much our tone changed from speaking with our corner only to speaking to all four corners helped me see why we have so many different forms of communication. People react differently in different settings, and our chosen form of communication reflects/matches that.
