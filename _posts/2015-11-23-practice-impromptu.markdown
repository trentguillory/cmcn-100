This activity solved the biggest problem I’ve had with impromptu speaking. That is, having an overflowing list of things to talk about in case your first topic isn’t sufficient. By holding my item in my hand, it brought back memories I wouldn’t have recalled otherwise. Even when I ran out of what I was going to say because I was speaking too fast, the object allowed me to dive deeper, talking about related stories. I learned that supporting stories are important when making a point.
