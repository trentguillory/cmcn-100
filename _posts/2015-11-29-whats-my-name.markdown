I had played this game many times before in other settings, so I first shuddered when Tiffany began to explain this game. It’s not my favorite, but this is a great example of fulfilling an expectation in communication. I can see this being applicable in seeing someone you’ve met before and priming your memory to revive the person’s name. It makes you nervous but you’ve got to try. I messed up a few times reciting everyone’s name but it was reassuring that it didn’t really matter because nobody was able to do it perfectly.
