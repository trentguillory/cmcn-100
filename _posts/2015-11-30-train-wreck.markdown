The self disclosing train wreck was especially beneficial in learning to step up to speak in your own time. Many of our other activities had defined “turns” where each person would go in order. There was no option. But in this game, one could easily slide over to the next available spot. It was up to everyone to play the game vulnerably, and possibly end up in the center. Beyond that it brought up a fear of rejection in me. Stating an interest or fact about myself was stressful at first because I thought nobody would move. Those fears subsided throughout the exercise.
