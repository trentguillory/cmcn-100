**Section 1a**

The skittle game was one of my favorite activities in class. I think this is because the realities of public speaking had not yet dawned on me. But seriously, the skittle game provided a way to get to know people quickly on a few different topics of life. Not only did it make me think and reach deep into my memory, but it challenged me to remember as much as I could about everyone else. I think the activity was a perfect model for meeting multiple people at once. Conversation should be engaging and one should actively listen to the stories shared by others.
